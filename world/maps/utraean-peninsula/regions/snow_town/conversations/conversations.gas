Follow the mountainside north and enter the Glacial Caverns. If you take care, you should find your way through to the Mount Utrae Forest. From there, follow the road until you come to the Ancient Temple entrance. I don't know what it's like this time of year, but it exits into the Crystal Caverns. Stay east and you will emerge on the hill overlooking the beach just northwest of Meren.";
